Monero is a cryptocurrency designed from scratch to deliver always-on privacy and anonymity.

No one can see how rich you are or how you spend, even if they know your wallet address. The amounts of transactions are confidential, and the source of funds in every transaction is untraceable. Always-on privacy means that every Monero user's activity enhances the privacy of all other users.

Monero's Kovri project (coming soon) encrypts and routes transactions through the I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes to protect you from network monitoring. 

Over 240 developers have contributed to the Monero project. Forums and chat channels are welcoming and active. Monero's Research Lab and Core Development Team is constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy and security.

To get started with Monero, download the Monero wallet. Then buy some Monero using dollars, pounds or euros from an exchange. The funds will appear in your Monero wallet, and you will be able to send funds to anyone, anywhere in the world.

## Monero
### Private Digital Currency

Monero is a secure, private, untraceable currency. It is open-source and freely available to all.With Monero, you are your own bank. Only you control and are responsible for your funds, and your accounts and transactions are kept private from prying eyes.

## What is Monero?

### Secure

Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 25 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, which can be written down to back up the account. Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are worthless if stolen.

### Private

Monero uses a cryptographically sound system that allows you to send and receive funds without your transactions being publicly visible on the blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and other transfers remain private by default.

### Untraceable

By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero enables untraceable transactions. This means it's ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user.
