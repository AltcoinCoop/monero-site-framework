Monero is a cryptocurrency designed from scratch to deliver always-on privacy and anonymity.

No one can see how rich you are or how you spend, even if they know your wallet address. The amounts of transactions are confidential, and the source of funds in every transaction is untraceable. Always-on privacy means that every Monero user's activity enhances the privacy of all other users.

Monero's Kovri project (coming soon) encrypts and routes transactions through the I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes to protect you from network monitoring. 

Over 240 developers have contributed to the Monero project. Forums and chat channels are welcoming and active. Monero's Research Lab and Core Development Team is constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy and security.

To get started with Monero, download the Monero wallet. Then buy some Monero using dollars, pounds or euros from an exchange. The funds will appear in your Monero wallet, and you will be able to send funds to anyone, anywhere in the world.
