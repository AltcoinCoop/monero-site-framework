_Note:_
This one is special because it provides a unique flow to get someone set up with Monero from start to finish. Please feel free to make changes to the flow I have provided by either addings, taking away, or changing categories. It'd be best if you make a new file called using-yourhandle.md to differentiate it from mine. Hope to see what people have worked up.
